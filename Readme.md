### Installation 
- Download the repository by clicking the "Download" button or by using Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
- Extract the downloaded repository to a folder on your local machine.
- Open a code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
- In the code editor, navigate to the extracted repository folder and open it as a project.
- To view the content properly, you will need to run a live server.  You can do this by installing a live server extension in your code editor, such as "Live Server" for Visual Studio Code. Once installed, open the project in the code editor and click on the "Go Live" button to start the live server.
- To run the server locally, you will need to install MAMP (or a similar software such as XAMPP). Once installed, start the MAMP server and configure it to run on the appropriate port.
- The backend of the project requires a database, you will need to create a database and import the necessary tables and data. You can use the phpMyAdmin tool provided by MAMP to manage your database.
- To run the API server with Lumen, you will need to install Lumen using Composer, which is a dependency manager for PHP. Once installed, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command "php -S localhost:8000 -t public". This will start the Lumen server and allow you to make API requests to the backend of the project.
